#### How To

I write documentation using markdown with obsidan. I have a plugin installed, but it doesn't allways translate correctly. So if things look odd, that's why.

I hope they help someone, I mostly got tried of looking at the same posts on stackoverflow and decided to write something so I can remember to look at it.

#### Recipes

A collection of things I've seen, cooked, or want to cook. YMMV

### Build this

If you want to build this, then fork this, install the pip packages, and start messing around with it.

This is uses mkdocs and mkdocs material for almost all the heavy lifting. The obsidian plugin does all the translations to make the rest of this work.

It also uses a blogging plugin since the material one isn't in the community build.
